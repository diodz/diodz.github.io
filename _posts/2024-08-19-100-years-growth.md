title: "Projecting 100 Years of GDP and Productivity Growth: Baseline vs. AI-Driven Futures"
date: 2024-08-19
categories: [AI, Long-run growth]

Long-run growth projections are more than an academic exercise; they inform today’s infrastructure, education, and climate policies. Below I simulate the next century of GDP and productivity for the **United States, China, the European Union, and India** under three distinct trajectories:

1. **Baseline:** present trends continue—no transformative AI.
2. **AGI Advantage:** one country (here, the US) gains a five-year head start with artificial general intelligence (AGI) in 2050.
3. **Global Catch-up:** AGI is quickly imitated; all four economies adopt it within a decade.

The numbers draw on IMF and OECD long-term forecasts for the baseline and on a range of academic/industry work (Korinek, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, Open Philanthropy) for AI impacts. All figures are in constant 2025 USD.

## Scenario Snapshots

| Scenario | 2050–2070 Highlights | 2125 Outcome (Total GDP) | 2125 Outcome (GDP per Capita) |
|----------|----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Baseline** | Growth slows gradually; China overtakes US ~2035; India’s demographic dividend peaks mid-century. | China ≈ US ≈ India > EU | US ≈ EU > China > India |
| **AGI Advantage** | US growth briefly triples; ~40 % GDP jump by 2055; others stay baseline until 2055. | China ≈ India ≈ US > EU (all far above baseline) | US keeps ~1.5× China, ~3× India |
| **Global Catch-up** | US jumps first, but China/EU/India ramp up by 2065; synchronized boom pushes world GDP higher than in any other scenario. | US ≈ China ≈ India > EU | Gaps narrow: US ≈ 1.2× China, 3× India |

## Baseline: Gradual Convergence Without Breakthroughs

* **Growth engine:** capital deepening, incremental tech, demographic shifts.  
* **Headwinds:** aging populations (China, EU), diminishing catch-up gains, sluggish productivity in advanced economies (1 – 2 %/yr).  
* **Result:** By the early 2030s China edges ahead of the US in total output. India overtakes the EU by the 2060s and threatens US/China scale after 2100. Living-standard gaps shrink but persist—US workers remain roughly twice as productive as Chinese and five times as productive as Indians at century’s end.

Key takeaway: **demography still matters** when technology changes slowly; big, young populations gradually dominate absolute GDP.

## AGI Advantage: Five Years That Reshape a Century

* **Trigger:** a US-led AGI breakthrough in 2050.  
* **Initial surge:** US real GDP growth ~8 %/yr for five years, lifting output ~40 % above baseline by 2055.  
* **Follower lag:** China, EU, India remain on baseline until they begin adopting AGI in 2055 but face slower diffusion.  
* **Persistent gap:** even after others automate, compound growth keeps US GDP per capita well ahead (≈ 250 k USD by 2060). Absolute GDP leadership lasts into the late century.

Strategic implication: **temporal monopolies in general-purpose technology translate into durable wealth and power—even if the monopoly is brief.**

## Global Catch-up: Shared Prosperity, Synchronized Boom

* **Rapid diffusion:** rivals absorb AGI within 10 years via R&D races, open science, or strategic leakage.  
* **Mid-century boom:** all four economies experience 5 – 8 % annual growth during the 2055-2065 adoption wave.  
* **Convergence:** by 2070, growth rates normalize around 1-2 %, but at a vastly higher production frontier.  
* **Outcome:** World GDP is highest in this scenario; no single hegemon dominates. Income gaps narrow but do not disappear, reflecting institutional and human-capital differences.

Lesson: **speed of diffusion, not raw invention, maximizes global output and reduces cross-country inequality.**

## Cross-Scenario Insights

1. **Technology vs. Demography:** AGI loosens the link between population size and economic heft—small countries with fast AI adoption out-produce larger laggards.  
2. **First-mover dividends:** Even a five-year lead compounded over decades yields trillions in extra output and geopolitical leverage.  
3. **Equity trade-off:** Concentrated AI gains (AGI Advantage) boost the frontier but leave world GDP lower than rapid diffusion (Global Catch-up) because millions of worker-years go under-augmented.  
4. **Policy Elasticity:** Institutions able to pivot—retraining, social insurance, capital-tax redesign—capture more of AI’s upside and cushion shocks.  
5. **Long-run growth ceiling:** In every path growth eventually reverts toward 1 – 2 % once AI saturation is reached and demographic expansion ends; the difference is the **level** of the new plateau.

## Policy Playbook for an AI-Rich Century

| Challenge | Action Items |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Labor displacement** | Universal reskilling subsidies; portable benefits; phased-in UBI pilots. |
| **Inequality** | Shift tax base from wages to capital/AI rents; strengthen antitrust to prevent AGI monopolies. |
| **Fiscal resilience** | Broaden tax nets (robot, data, IP royalties); pre-fund pension systems before wage share falls. |
| **Global governance** | Push for open models, safety standards, and AI audit treaties to accelerate—but secure—diffusion. |
| **Adaptive planning** | Scenario-based budgeting; real-time AI progress tracking units inside finance and labor ministries. |

## Conclusion

Whether growth plods along familiar demographic grooves or leaps onto a new AGI-powered trajectory hinges on **who builds, who shares, and how fast**. A five-year technological head start compounded over decades can remake global power maps; equally, rapid diffusion can transform today’s emerging markets into coequals.

The models here are necessarily stylized, but one principle is robust: **productivity drives destiny**. If AGI can unlock orders-of-magnitude gains, the policy decisions we make **before** it arrives—on education, safety nets, and global cooperation—will determine whether that destiny is broadly prosperous or perilously unequal.
