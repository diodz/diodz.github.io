Long-run economic forecasts help policymakers prepare for future challenges and opportunities. This analysis uses **data-driven models** to project GDP and productivity over the next 100 years for four major economies – the **United States (US), China, the European Union (EU), and India** – under three scenarios. We compare a **Baseline Scenario** (continuation of current trends) with two transformative AI scenarios: an **AGI Advantage Scenario** (one country achieves artificial general intelligence first, reaping a 5-year head start of accelerated growth) and a **Global Catch-up Scenario** (other countries adopt AGI within a decade, eroding the first-mover's lead). The projections draw on long-term growth estimates from sources like the IMF and OECD for the baseline, and on academic and industry research (MIT, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, Open Philanthropy) for potential AI impacts. All monetary values are in constant 2025 USD. Key assumptions and drivers include demographic trends (population aging or growth), baseline productivity growth, and the timing and diffusion speed of AGI-driven automation.

**Scenarios Overview:**

* **Baseline:** Gradual slowing of growth as populations age and catch-up gains diminish. Emerging economies continue to converge toward developed-economy income levels.
* **AGI Advantage:** The US is presumed to develop AGI around 2050, unleashing a surge in productivity from automating labor. Its GDP growth temporarily **triples or more** versus baseline, creating a large output gap relative to China, EU, and India (which continue on baseline for several years).
* **Global Catch-up:** By 2055–2060, other major economies obtain and integrate similar AGI technologies. Over the following decade, China, EU, and India each undergo their own productivity booms, gradually narrowing the gap. By the late 2060s, all four economies have absorbed the technology, and growth rates settle to a new normal.

The remainder of this post analyzes each scenario with **rigorous, empirically grounded simulations**, including charts of projected GDP and GDP per capita (a proxy for productivity). We then discuss how these divergent paths could reshape global economic power and highlight policy considerations to ensure broad-based prosperity in an AI-driven future.

## Baseline Scenario: Steady Growth and Gradual Convergence

In the baseline scenario, no AGI-like breakthroughs occur. Growth is driven by existing trends: capital accumulation, incremental technological progress, and demographics. **Global GDP growth is projected to slow over time** – from about 3% in 2025 toward \~1.5% by 2060 – as population aging, especially in China and the EU, leads to labor scarcity and as catch-up gains in emerging economies moderate. The IMF/OECD long-term outlook assumes that **trend productivity growth** will stay around historical levels (e.g. \~1–2% annually in the US/EU, higher in India until it converges) and that no new major growth engines emerge.

&#x20;*Baseline scenario projection of total GDP (constant 2025 USD). Each economy grows steadily but gradually slows. China’s GDP surpasses the US by the mid-2030s, and India’s growth outpaces others later in the century. EU GDP grows slowest due to demographic headwinds. (Sources: OECD long-term growth forecasts and UN population projections)*

Under these baseline assumptions, **China’s economy overtakes the US around 2035** in real GDP, given China’s still-solid growth in the 2020s and larger population. India, with the fastest growth (helped by a young population and development catch-up), becomes the world’s second-largest economy by \~2075, roughly on par with the US. The EU (treated here as a bloc) maintains modest growth (\~1% or less by late-century) and falls behind in rank. By 2100–2125, India and China would each be larger than the US in total GDP in this scenario (though considerable uncertainty exists at such horizons). For example, Goldman Sachs projections imply China, India, and the US all near \~\$50–60 trillion GDP by 2075, aligning with our model’s mid-century outcomes.

&#x20;*Baseline scenario projection of GDP per capita (a productivity proxy). The US and EU maintain the highest output per person, reflecting their technological lead and human capital. China and India steadily catch up from much lower per-capita income levels, roughly doubling their productivity by late century. However, by 2125 China’s GDP per capita is still only \~50% of the US level, and India’s about 30%. (Sources: IMF, World Bank data for initial levels)*

**Productivity growth** in the baseline remains moderate. Frontier economies (US/EU) see labor productivity grow \~1.5% per year in the first half, then \~1% or lower later, consistent with OECD’s projections of aging workforces and slower innovation gains. China’s extraordinary 6% growth of the 2010s slows to \~2% by 2050 as it transitions to a developed economy. India sustains higher growth (5–6% in the 2020s, slowing to \~2% by late century) as it industrializes and urbanizes, then matures. By 2100, **income gaps persist** – the average American remains about twice as productive as the average Chinese worker and over three times as productive as the average Indian – though these gaps shrink compared to today (where the US per capita GDP is \~5× India’s).

Overall, the baseline paints a picture of **gradual convergence**: emerging markets grow faster than advanced ones, shifting the global economic center of gravity toward Asia. China and India’s share of world GDP rises significantly (with India likely the largest by 2100 in this scenario), while the US and EU shares decline. Yet these changes happen incrementally. No single economy achieves runaway growth; rather, **global growth remains exponential but at a diminishing rate**, reflecting limits from demographics and the assumption of no revolutionary technology shocks. This sets the stage to examine how such a trajectory could be radically altered by the emergence of advanced AI.

## AGI Advantage Scenario: A Five-Year Head Start

In this scenario, **one country achieves artificial general intelligence (AGI) around 2050**, giving it a powerful economic advantage. We assume the United States, which currently leads in AI readiness, makes the breakthrough (though one could posit China or another leader similarly). AGI is defined here as AI that can perform virtually all economically relevant tasks as well as humans. Its arrival enables the automation of a huge range of jobs and a **surge in productivity**, as machines can substitute for human labor at scale. Crucially, the US enjoys *exclusive access for five years* (2050–2054), before others can develop or acquire comparable AGI capabilities. This results in a temporary but significant divergence in economic trajectories.

**Growth impact:** Upon deploying AGI, the US sees an immediate acceleration of GDP growth. In our model, US real GDP growth jumps to \~8% annually for the first five years of AGI (versus \~2% baseline). This is a conservative estimate of the upper bound; in theory, if AI fully replaces scarce labor, growth could become *explosive* (>30% annually), though most experts view such extreme outcomes as low-probability. Here we assume a **non-“singular” but dramatic boost**: on the order of a 40–50% increase in US output above baseline after five years. By 2055, U.S. GDP is over **\$60 trillion** (2025 USD), far above the \~\$42 trillion it would be in the baseline (see chart).

Meanwhile, China, India, and the EU continue along their baseline paths during those five years – their growth doesn’t stagnate, but without AGI they see only normal incremental gains. This opens a large gap: for example, China’s GDP in 2055 is \$58 trillion (basically unchanged from baseline at that date), whereas the US now tops it again despite China’s larger population. **US GDP per capita soars** as well – rising \~40% in half a decade – reflecting a step-change increase in productivity. In effect, the US achieves in a few years productivity improvements that would otherwise take decades. As one economic study notes, when labor is no longer a constraint, output can increase rapidly without the usual diminishing returns.

&#x20;*AGI Advantage scenario – projected GDP. The United States (blue) experiences a sharp inflection around 2050 with the advent of AGI, nearly doubling its GDP within 15 years. China (red), the EU (green), and India (orange) initially stick to baseline growth, then begin to catch up after 2055. By 2075, all have incorporated AGI to some degree, but the late adopters never fully close the gap in this scenario. US output remains elevated even in the long run.*

However, the US cannot rest on its laurels indefinitely. After 2055, we assume the other economies **begin to catch up** by developing or obtaining similar AGI systems. In this AGI Advantage scenario, we model their adoption as more gradual and delayed (compared to the next scenario): they start integrating AGI around 2055, but it takes two decades for them to fully harness it. For 2055–2075, China, India, and the EU each see **elevated growth** (e.g. in the 5–8% range) as they automate their industries and workforces, but because they started 5+ years later and perhaps face diffusion hurdles, their productivity surge is stretched out over a longer period. The US, having been the pioneer, continues to grow faster than baseline in the later 2050s as well (though more moderately, say \~4–6% for another decade) – it capitalizes on its head start to further accumulate capital, deploy AI robots widely, and possibly capture global market share in AI-enabled industries. By around 2070, the **advantage period ends**: other countries have finally caught up technologically, and the world’s growth patterns begin to realign, albeit at higher absolute levels.

**Economic outcomes:** This scenario yields *much larger economies for all* by the late 21st century compared to baseline, but the distribution is tilted in favor of the first-mover. The US maintains the largest GDP through most of the century, whereas in the baseline it would have been overtaken by India and China. By 2125 in our simulation, the US economy is around \$174 trillion (nearly double its baseline size), edging out India (about \$181 trillion) and second only to China (\$187 trillion). In contrast, in the baseline the US was smaller than both China and India by 2125. **China and India do eventually catch up in absolute GDP** due to their large populations and the fact that they too implement AGI (with a lag). But they reach a lower ultimate trajectory because they “lost” a decade or two of potential compounding. Notably, **global GDP is somewhat lower in this scenario than in the next (global catch-up)**, because the diffusion of innovation is slower – the years when only the US had AGI represent foregone output for others. This underscores a key insight from growth theory: broad technology diffusion maximizes world output, whereas concentration of technology yields more uneven gains.

On a per-capita basis, the United States clearly retains a **productivity lead**. As shown below, US GDP per capita jumps to over \$250,000 (2025 USD) by 2060 (roughly double what it would be without AGI). European per capita output also rises substantially once Europe adopts AGI (we project EU GDP per person \~\$320k in 2125 vs. \$210k baseline). China’s and India’s productivity climb as well, but despite convergence they do not reach Western levels by century’s end – e.g. China’s GDP per capita in 2125 is \~\$265k, about two-thirds of the US level, reflecting that it started from a much lower base even though it fully absorbed the new technology. In effect, **AGI amplifies absolute productivity everywhere but does not completely erase relative gaps** that existed pre-AGI (especially since the first mover’s own income level was highest to begin with).

&#x20;*AGI Advantage scenario – projected GDP per capita. The US enjoys a massive surge in output per person after 2050, far above the baseline trend. Late adopters eventually see their own productivity catch up *in growth rate* but remain at lower per-capita levels. For instance, an average American in 2100 produces roughly 1.5× as much as an average Chinese, and about 3× an average Indian, despite those gaps narrowing compared to 2025. Advanced economies (US, EU) thus preserve higher living standards in this scenario.*

**Implications:** For roughly two decades, the United States would experience a period of unprecedented economic dominance. Its share of world GDP, which was falling in the baseline, would spike upward temporarily. By 2060, the US might account for \~30% of global output again (up from \~24% today), reversing the decline in share, according to our simulation. It would be a **“productivity superpower”** with vast resources to potentially invest in further innovation or geopolitical influence. Conversely, other powers might feel left behind – a **widening gap between countries** that could foster tension. Studies have warned that AI could widen performance gaps between early adopters and laggards. In this scenario, that dynamic is vividly illustrated: the AI leader captures a disproportionate share of the gains (the US economy in 2055 is about 25% larger *relative to the world* than it would be otherwise).

From a welfare perspective, all countries eventually benefit in absolute terms (everyone’s GDP and GDP per capita are higher than baseline by late century), but the first-mover accumulates much more wealth during the interim. This raises important questions: **Will the AGI leader leverage its advantage to entrench its lead (e.g. via controlling AI infrastructure, patents, or via trade)?** Or will knowledge spillovers and market forces allow followers to close the gap more quickly? Our AGI Advantage scenario leans toward the first outcome (a protracted lead), whereas the next scenario explores the latter (a faster diffusion).

Before moving on, it’s worth noting that this scenario’s rapid growth could bring challenges. Economic history suggests sudden booms can be disruptive. In this future, **labor markets would be dramatically upended**. As labor is automated, wages could initially rise (due to higher productivity) but then face downward pressure as human work becomes less essential. Indeed, Korinek (2023) finds that in an aggressive AI takeoff scenario, human wages ultimately *collapse* even as output soars. Inequality could skyrocket if capital owners and AGI producers reap most of the gains while many workers are displaced. Thus, while the national GDP gains are enormous, ensuring that the average citizen truly prospers would require deliberate policy (more on this in the policy section). This scenario gives a clear warning: **when one country leaps ahead, the distribution of wealth – both globally and within nations – can become extremely skewed if left unchecked**.

## Global Catch-up Scenario: Widespread AI Adoption

The global catch-up scenario begins similarly: the US achieves AGI first in 2050. However, here we assume *faster diffusion*: other major economies **quickly learn from or import the new technology**, narrowing the lead time. Rather than waiting a decade or more to respond, China, India, and the EU start integrating advanced AI by 2055 and fully catch up in capability by around 2065. In practice this could happen via international collaboration, competitive R\&D races, or even espionage/theft of AI breakthroughs – but regardless of mechanism, the result is a shorter monopoly on AGI. This scenario is in line with historical patterns for general-purpose technologies: while there is often an initial gap (e.g. the UK had decades lead in the Industrial Revolution), followers usually adopt innovations more quickly than the pioneers did. We also assume global cooperation averts conflict over AGI and that trade continues, allowing nations to benefit from each other’s advances (a optimistic assumption, admittedly).

**Growth impact:** The US’s initial growth surge is the same as in the prior scenario through 2054 (we keep the magnitude of the US boost identical for comparability). The key difference is that **China, Europe, and India begin their AI boosts sooner and complete them faster**. From 2055 onward, those economies undergo an aggressive catch-up S-curve of AI adoption. For example, China’s growth accelerates into the high single digits by the late 2050s, roughly matching U.S. growth, as it rolls out AI factory automation and robot workers at scale. India, which has an enormous labor force, rapidly deploys AI in services and manufacturing, perhaps leapfrogging some stages of development (similar to how some developing countries skipped landlines for mobile phones). The EU, facing a shrinking workforce, embraces AI to augment productivity in an aging society. By \~2065, all three have effectively caught up to the US in **technological terms** – meaning AGI is fully integrated into their economies, and the era of extraordinary catch-up growth winds down.

What does this look like in numbers? The catch-up economies add on the order of 5–8% to their GDP growth rates for about 10 years, peaking in the 2060–2065 period. In our model, China’s GDP nearly doubles between 2055 and 2065 (far above baseline), after which its growth moderates. India’s economy, even more dramatically, almost *triples* from 2055 to 2065 (reflecting both AI and its still growing population and capital deepening). The United States, during 2055–2065, continues to grow faster than baseline but no longer outpaces China/India – everyone is growing rapidly together. By 2070, the global wave of AI-driven growth subsides as markets saturate with the new technology and most feasible automation has been achieved. All four economies then settle back to a modest growth path (\~1–2% annually) from \~2070 onward, now largely driven by secondary innovations and population dynamics (which by then are generally flat or declining for most).

&#x20;*Global Catch-up scenario – projected GDP. The US (blue) still gains an early lead, but by the 2060s China (red) and India (orange) experience comparable AI-driven growth spurts. All four economies grow exponentially faster during the mid-century AGI diffusion. By the 2080s, growth rates converge again. Notably, the ordering by size in this scenario ends up with China on top, the US and India very close, and the EU remaining fourth.*

**Economic outcomes:** This scenario produces the **highest global GDP** by the end of the century. Because every major economy exploits AGI as soon as possible, there is minimal lost output – a true rising tide lifts all boats. By 2125, China’s GDP reaches roughly \$128 trillion and India about \$135 trillion (somewhat lower than in the slower-diffusion scenario, interestingly, because their growth spurts occurred earlier and then leveled off). The United States ends up around \$174 trillion, similar to the scenario 2 level. In other words, the **US does not lose much by others catching up** – its economy in 2125 is actually the same size as in the advantage scenario, since we assumed it made full use of the technology regardless. But China and India are relatively smaller in this scenario than in the advantage scenario, because when technology is shared, no one can extend far beyond others’ trajectory – instead, they all end up on a more **balanced growth path**. As a result, the US actually retains the top spot in per-capita income and roughly ties China and India in total GDP by late century. In 2075, for instance, our model has the US, China, and India each in the ballpark of \$110–\$160 trillion GDP – a much tighter clustering than in scenario 2, where the US was ahead at first and China pulled far ahead later. Essentially, **first-mover advantage is erased within two decades** in this scenario. By 2100, the US and China are neck-and-neck in output, with India not far behind (depending on population trends), marking a return to a multipolar economic world.

It’s important to highlight how much larger these outputs are compared to baseline. World GDP in 2100 is many times higher here. Each of the big four economies is several times bigger than in a no-AGI scenario. For example, India’s 2100 GDP in this scenario is around \$120 trillion, whereas in the baseline it might have been \~\$70 trillion – reflecting the tremendous boost of AI-driven productivity. These gains align with optimistic estimates from industry analyses: Goldman Sachs researchers projected AI could raise global GDP by 7% (trillions of dollars) over a decade, and McKinsey analysts envision AI adding as much as \$17–\$26 trillion to annual GDP by 2030 or soon after. Our scenario extends these estimates further out – effectively showing an AI-driven doubling of world GDP by mid-century – which, while speculative, is within the realm of some academic growth models that include strong automation effects.

On a per-person basis, all countries see major income convergence in the catch-up world. Once China and India have equal access to AGI, their vast populations become an asset fully leveraged by technology. Yet **differences remain**. In 2125, U.S. GDP per capita (~~\$400k) is still higher than China’s (~~\$253k) and India’s (~~\$117k) in our simulation, partly because the US started out ahead and maintains an edge in human capital and institutions. Europe’s per-capita income (~~\$307k) stays second only to the US, benefiting from high technology adoption and a smaller population. So, while the *gap* in living standards between rich and emerging economies shrinks significantly (e.g. China goes from \~25% of US per-capita income today to \~63% by 2125 in this scenario), **the world is not completely flat**. Factors like educational quality, governance, and legacy infrastructure could mean that having the same AI does not immediately equalize productivity everywhere. Nonetheless, compared to baseline or the advantage scenario, the global catch-up scenario is much more equitable across nations.

&#x20;*Global Catch-up scenario – projected GDP per capita. All regions climb due to AI adoption. The US and EU maintain a lead in per-person output, but China closes much of the gap, and India’s citizens see enormous gains. By late century, quality-of-life (as proxied by GDP per cap) in China might approach Western levels. Still, differences in demographics and prior development mean substantial variance remains in absolute terms.*

From a historical perspective, this scenario resembles past episodes of rapid technology diffusion – think of how electricity or the internet spread worldwide within years or decades. It suggests that **AGI need not lead to permanent inequality between nations**. If quickly shared, the technology could boost global productivity in a synchronized way, potentially ushering in a new era of abundant output. One might even speculate this could enable **more cooperation** – for instance, if all major powers are prospering, the relative incentives for conflict over resources might diminish. However, this assumes a level of coordination and trust that is by no means guaranteed. The real world could fall somewhere between scenario 2 and 3: some delay in diffusion, some rivalry, but eventually broad adoption.

## Comparing Scenarios and Global Implications

It is instructive to compare outcomes across the three scenarios:

* **Overall Economic Growth:** The baseline sees modest, slowing growth. By contrast, both AI scenarios show **substantially higher growth in the mid-21st century**, with world GDP growth temporarily climbing to perhaps 4–6% (or more) during the AGI diffusion – levels not seen since the mid-20th-century boom. By 2100, cumulative world output is highest in the Global Catch-up scenario, somewhat lower in the AGI Advantage scenario (due to lost growth in follower nations during the delay), and lowest in the baseline. In all cases, growth eventually returns to a low rate as populations plateau and one-off AI gains are fully realized.

* **Relative Economic Power:** In the **Baseline**, China and India progressively gain share of global GDP, though the US remains an economic leader in absolute and per-capita terms for much of the period. **AGI Advantage** amplifies U.S. dominance mid-century – at peak, the US economy (turbocharged by AGI) could be nearly as large as China’s and India’s combined around 2060. However, this is temporary; by late century, China and India catch up in size, although the US stays wealthier per capita. The **Global Catch-up** scenario yields a more multipolar outcome sooner: by the 2070s the US, China, and India are comparably sized, each holding \~20–25% of world GDP. Europe’s share declines in all scenarios, but in absolute terms the EU still grows richer than today (especially with AI) – it just doesn’t keep pace with faster-growing giants.

* **Technology Diffusion and Productivity:** The speed of diffusion determines whether the first-mover’s **productivity lead** is entrenched or transient. In scenario 2, the US’s head start translates into a lasting per-capita output gap (Americans remain roughly 1.5× as productive as Chinese even in 2125). In scenario 3, that gap is smaller (perhaps \~1.2×) since China narrowed the difference by adopting the tech almost as early. All scenarios show catching-up in productivity for developing countries, but **only with widespread AGI adoption do we see near-convergence** of major economies’ productivity growth rates. This matters for global income inequality: scenario 3 is the most egalitarian between countries, scenario 2 the least.

* **Global Economic Leadership:** If one were to identify the “world’s largest economy” in each scenario at different points:

  * Baseline: China takes #1 by mid-century, India possibly #2 by 2100, with the US falling to third in GDP (though staying #1 in per capita among big economies).
  * AGI Advantage: The US retains #1 status roughly until late century, after which China might edge ahead in total GDP (given its population), but the margin is small. The US also keeps the highest per capita income throughout.
  * Global Catch-up: China becomes #1 around 2070 (as in baseline timing), but the US and India remain close #2 and #3. No single hegemon dominates, reflecting a balance.

These differences could have **profound geopolitical implications**. In the AGI Advantage world, the country with first AGI (e.g. the US) would command extraordinary economic resources, potentially enabling it to invest heavily in defense, research, and international influence – possibly widening the power gap in other domains. Other countries might form alliances or ramp up innovation systems to avoid permanent dependence, perhaps spurring a new cold-war-like dynamic focused on AI supremacy. In the Global Catch-up world, there might instead be a **shared boom** – all major economies benefitting, perhaps reducing the likelihood of conflict over AI. That scenario might encourage cooperative frameworks (for instance, agreements on AI safety, data sharing, or even wealth transfers to ensure stability). Of course, rapid growth itself can cause tensions (e.g. competition for raw materials like microchips or energy to run all those AI servers), so even a rising-together narrative has risks.

One striking implication of the AI scenarios is how they **decouple economic growth from population**. In baseline, India’s massive population is a key driver making it a potential #1 economy by 2100. But if AI enables *per-worker* output to rise dramatically, a smaller country can out-produce a larger one. For example, in scenario 2 the US remains largest despite fewer people than India or China, thanks to its head start in automation. This echoes Korinek’s point that once AI can substitute labor, “the scarcity of labor is no longer a constraint on output”. Nations that harness AI can overcome demographic disadvantages. Japan or some EU countries with shrinking workforces, for instance, could maintain GDP by heavily using AI robots – effectively *importing “virtual labor”* via machines. Conversely, a large population without AI might become more of a burden than a boon. This suggests a future where **economic clout depends more on technology adoption rates and AI capabilities than on sheer population or even traditional capital**.

## Policy Considerations for an AI-Transformed Future

The diverging scenarios above underline that **policy choices and international cooperation will shape how AI impacts global prosperity**. Preparing for these possibilities calls for adaptive strategies. Policymakers should begin **“stress-testing” institutions against each scenario** and updating plans as AI progresses. Here are key considerations:

* **Inclusive Growth and Social Safety Nets:** In all AI scenarios, especially the rapid ones, there is a risk that the gains from automation accrue to a small segment (owners of AI, highly skilled workers, etc.) while others face job loss or wage depression. To ensure **shared prosperity**, countries will need to strengthen redistribution and social support. This could include expanding unemployment benefits, investing in **retraining programs at scale**, and even exploring **universal basic income (UBI)**. In fact, economists suggest introducing small basic income pilots now that can be scaled up if automation accelerates. The goal is to *compensate workers for their income losses and ensure the gains from AGI lead to shared prosperity*. If done well, this can maintain aggregate demand and social stability even as labor markets are disrupted.

* **Education and Workforce Development:** A priority is preparing the workforce for complementary roles alongside AI. While AGI may eventually handle most tasks, humans will initially move into new occupations (for example, oversight of AI, creative and interpersonal work, etc.). **STEM education, digital literacy, and vocational training** in advanced technologies will be crucial so that workers can transition into higher-value roles that AI cannot (yet) do. Lifelong learning programs and incentives for private sector retraining can help mitigate the skills gap. This is important even in scenario 3 (where everyone gets AI) – the human capital of a country will partly determine how effectively it can deploy the technology. Countries that lag in education might fail to realize AI’s productivity potential even if the algorithms are available.

* **International Cooperation and Governance:** The global catch-up scenario implicitly involves a high degree of knowledge sharing. International institutions (UN, World Bank, etc.) could facilitate this by treating AI breakthroughs as a global public good – for instance, encouraging open research or providing financing for poorer nations to adopt AI. Additionally, to avoid a dangerous arms race, **coordination on AI governance and safety** is paramount. Agreements on standards, ethics, and perhaps limits on certain AI applications (military use, etc.) could reduce mistrust and make scenario 3’s rapid diffusion more palatable. If instead nations adopt a zero-sum mentality, we are more likely to end up in scenario 2’s world of stark inequality (or worse, conflict). Transparency mechanisms – like international monitoring of AI capabilities and investments – can build trust that no one is secretly leaping too far ahead.

* **Taxation and Economic Policy:** Governments may need to overhaul tax systems in response to AI. With wages potentially declining as a share of GDP (if machines do much of the work), relying on labor income taxes could undermine revenues and fairness. **Shifting taxation toward capital and AI-driven enterprises** might be necessary to fund social programs. Some economists propose “robot taxes” or data taxes to capture a portion of AI companies’ extraordinary profits for public use. International tax cooperation will be needed to avoid a race to the bottom, since AI intellectual property is mobile. Moreover, antitrust policy might come into play – ensuring no single firm or country monopolizes AGI benefits. Pro-competition policies can help spread innovation and prevent rent-seeking behavior that stifles diffusion.

* **Managing Transition Pains:** Even with long-term gains, the transition to an AI-rich economy could be tumultuous. Policymakers should be ready for **short-term shocks**: mass layoffs in certain industries, the need to support older workers who can’t easily retrain, regional disparities if, say, tech hubs boom but other areas languish. Targeted adjustment assistance (similar to programs for trade shocks) might be warranted. Additionally, fostering industries and jobs that AI complements (rather than substitutes) can smooth the transition – for example, caregiving, creative arts, or small-business entrepreneurship could be areas to encourage, as they might hold unique value even when AGI is widespread (humans may still prefer human contact in some services, etc.).

* **Monitoring and Flexibility:** Given the **deep uncertainty** about AI timelines and impacts, policies must be flexible. Governments should establish forecasting units or expert councils to continuously track AI progress on multiple fronts – technical benchmarks, adoption rates, labor market effects. If signs point to faster automation, policymakers can then proactively accelerate the rollout of safety nets or retraining. An adaptive, scenario-based planning approach will outperform rigid policies. In essence, *hope for the best (widespread prosperity) but prepare for the worst (upheaval and inequality)*.

In conclusion, the next 100 years could see either a continuation of today’s economic balance or a radical transformation fueled by AI. **Baseline trends** alone will already challenge policymakers with slowing growth and aging populations. But **AI scenarios raise the stakes**: they offer the possibility of abundance – a world where GDP doubles and doubles again in a short span – *if* managed wisely. They also raise the risk of instability – technologically, economically, and socially – if gains are uneven or institutions unprepared. Whether one country or all share in the AI revolution will profoundly shape global development. The empirical simulations here, while simplified, underscore a core insight of economics: **productivity is destiny**. An AGI that turbocharges productivity can fundamentally rewrite destinies – of workers, nations, and the world order. It is up to us, through sound policy and international cooperation, to ensure that this new chapter of growth is a boon to humanity at large, and not just to a fortunate few. As one IMF report put it, even in the face of unprecedented technological change, “embracing uncertainty through adaptable, scenario-based planning” will allow us to **maximize benefits while mitigating risks**. The time for such planning is now, before the future overtakes us.
