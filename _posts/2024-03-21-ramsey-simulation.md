# Ramsey Simulation

This post demonstrates a simulation of the Ramsey model, showing the dynamics of capital accumulation and consumption over time.

## About the Simulation

The Ramsey model is a neoclassical model of economic growth. This simulation shows:

1. The evolution of capital stock over time
2. The optimal consumption path
3. The steady state equilibrium

The interactive visualization allows you to:
- Adjust key parameters
- See the impact on the economy's growth path
- Understand the relationship between savings and consumption

## Technical Details

The simulation is built using:
- D3.js for visualization
- JavaScript for calculations
- HTML5 for the interface

Feel free to experiment with different parameters to see how they affect the economy's growth path.
