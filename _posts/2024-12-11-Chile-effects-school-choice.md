Chile’s market-oriented education system—implemented nationwide in 1981 via school vouchers—offers a unique case to examine how school choice policies affect academic performance and educational equity. This study analyzes Chile’s experience with universal school vouchers and other school choice mechanisms (analogous to charter schools in other contexts), drawing on recent empirical evidence, national statistics, and international assessments. We document that Chile’s extensive school choice regime produced a massive shift of enrollment from public to privately managed schools, with only modest gains in average test scores and persistent inequalities. In particular, *student achievement* (as measured by national and international exams) improved slightly over the long run but stagnated in recent years, remaining below OECD averages. At the same time, *educational equity* challenges endure: socioeconomic achievement gaps and school segregation reached very high levels following the voucher reform. We compare Chile’s outcomes with evidence from other countries’ school choice programs—including targeted voucher experiments and charter school systems—using rigorous econometric studies (difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, lottery-based trials, etc.). While some choice policies yield benefits for certain student subgroups or competitive gains, the Chilean case underscores the risk of exacerbating socioeconomic stratification without significant overall improvement in performance. These findings highlight the importance of policy design: regulations (e.g. targeted funding, admission rules) can mitigate adverse effects on equity while preserving potential efficiency gains. We conclude with implications for education policy in Chile and internationally, emphasizing that well-designed school choice programs require safeguards to ensure quality improvement and equal opportunity.

## 1. Introduction

School choice has been at the forefront of global education policy debates for decades. Proponents argue that giving families the ability to choose schools—whether through vouchers, charter schools, or open enrollment—will spur competition and improve educational outcomes. Milton Friedman famously contended that introducing market forces via vouchers would “provide the public schools with the competition that will force them to improve”. Chile provides a critical test case of these theories: in 1981, under a sweeping neoliberal reform, Chile became the first country to implement a universal school voucher system. Since then, Chilean families have been able to take a government subsidy to any school, public or private, that agrees to accept the voucher. This reform created a *quasi-market* in education, transforming the organizational landscape of schools and raising important questions about effectiveness and equity.

This paper examines the effects of Chile’s school choice policies on academic achievement and educational equity, and compares them with outcomes observed in other countries. We adopt an empirical approach characteristic of economics research, drawing on a range of data sources (national test scores, international assessments like PISA and UNESCO’s TERCE, and government statistics) and credible studies with rigorous identification strategies. The analysis covers various forms of school choice in Chile – from the core voucher program (applicable to both public and private-subsidized schools) to the *charter-like* private subsidized schools that operate with public funding but private management. We assess impacts on student outcomes such as test scores and graduation rates, as well as equity dimensions including socioeconomic achievement gaps and segregation by income or ethnicity.

Chile’s experience is placed in context by comparing it to evidence from other settings. For instance, Sweden’s nationwide voucher reform, numerous voucher experiments in the United States and developing countries, and charter school systems across different countries offer points of contrast. These comparisons help illustrate which effects of school choice might be general versus context-specific. The Chilean case is especially valuable given its long timeline (over 40 years since reform) and near-universal scale, in contrast to many small-scale or pilot programs elsewhere. At the same time, Chile underwent additional reforms (e.g. a targeted voucher in 2008, and new regulations in the 2010s) that shed light on how policy design tweaks can alter outcomes.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background on Chile’s school system and the implementation of school choice policies, including the dramatic shift toward privately operated schools. Section 3 describes the data and empirical methods used to evaluate these policies, highlighting key studies and their identification strategies (such as difference-in-differences and quasi-experimental designs). Section 4 presents results on academic outcomes, while Section 5 examines effects on educational equity, including segregation and achievement gaps. Section 6 offers an international comparative perspective, drawing parallels and contrasts with school choice outcomes in other countries. Section 7 concludes with a discussion of policy implications, emphasizing the lessons from Chile’s experience for the design of equitable and effective school choice programs.

## 2. Policy Background: School Choice and the Chilean Education System

Chile’s universal voucher system was introduced as part of a broad neoliberal restructuring under the Pinochet regime. Before 1981, the vast majority of Chilean students attended traditional public schools administered by the central government. The 1981 reform decentralized public schools to municipal control and created a funding system where *“the money follows the student”*: each student received a voucher (a per-student subsidy) that could be used to enroll in either a public school or a privately operated school that agreed to accept the voucher. This reform blurred the line between public and private provision, effectively turning public schools and private subsidized schools into competitors for enrollment. Chile thus developed three main types of schools: **municipal public schools** (funded by vouchers and run by local governments), **private subsidized schools** (funded by vouchers but privately managed, including for-profit and non-profit operators, similar in spirit to charter schools), and **private paid schools** (elite institutions that charge full tuition and take no vouchers).

**Table 1. Enrollment by School Type in Chile (Selected Years)**

| Year | Municipal Public (%) | Private Subsidized (%) | Private Paid (%) |
| ---- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1981 | 78                   | 12                     | \~10             |
| 1991 | 58                   | 32                     | \~10             |
| 2006 | 47                   | 45                     | 8                |
| 2014 | 37                   | 54                     | \~8              |

*Source:* Ministry of Education and authors’ compilation from historical enrollment data. (Private paid includes non-subsidized private schools; figures may not sum exactly to 100% due to a small “delegated” public category.)

Table 1 illustrates the profound change in school enrollment patterns following the 1981 voucher reform. In 1981, approximately 78% of Chile’s primary and secondary students attended public schools, and only around 15% were in private schools (mostly elite or religious schools with limited state subsidies before the reform). By 1991, a decade into the voucher system, public school enrollment had fallen to about 58%, with roughly one-third of students in the new private subsidized sector. The trend continued over the next two decades: by 2006, public schools served less than half of all students (47%), roughly equal to the voucher-accepting private sector (45%). According to Ministry of Education data, the shift persisted into the 2010s – by 2014 public schools accounted for only 37% of enrollment, while a majority (54%) attended private subsidized schools and about 7–8% were in non-subsidized private schools. In essence, Chile now has a predominantly “choice-based” system in which over 90% of students are educated with public funding in either municipal or private-managed schools.

Several policy features accompanied the voucher system’s evolution. Initially, private subsidized schools could not charge tuition on top of the voucher, but over time the government permitted **“shared financing” (co-payments)**, allowing these schools to collect additional fees from families up to a regulated cap. Many private voucher schools introduced fees, making about 90% of them *de facto* semi-private in cost. This raised concerns that low-income families might still be excluded from some ostensibly “free choice” schools. In response, the Chilean state introduced a *targeted voucher* program in 2008 (known as the Preferential School Subsidy, SEP). The SEP reform provided extra funds for vulnerable (low-income) students and prohibited schools receiving those funds from charging co-payments to such students. It also tied the additional resources to accountability measures, requiring participating schools to meet certain achievement goals to continue receiving the extra subsidy. In 2016, further reforms (the Inclusion Law) outlawed selective admissions for most schools and began phasing out for-profit schooling and co-payments entirely at the primary and lower-secondary levels, with the aim of reducing inequities. These policy shifts within Chile’s voucher system create natural points of analysis: the *unregulated voucher era* (1981–2000s) versus the *reforms of the late 2000s–2010s* that sought to address some negative consequences.

Beyond vouchers, Chile’s education landscape also includes **selective public schools and early charter-like experiments**. For example, a number of *emblematic schools* (particularly in Santiago) are public high schools with entrance exams, and these often attract high-performing students nationwide. While not a focus of this paper, their presence is noted as part of the “public-private dynamics” of school choice, since families compete to enter these elite public options as well. However, unlike the United States and some other nations, Chile did not develop a separate charter school sector – instead, the role that charter schools play elsewhere (independently run public schools of choice) is effectively fulfilled by Chile’s private subsidized schools. These schools have considerable autonomy in management (curriculum, teacher hiring, etc.) and prior to recent reforms, they had freedom to select students and set fees within guidelines. Thus, the Chilean voucher system can be seen as an expansive, nationally scaled version of a charter/voucher hybrid model.

In sum, Chile’s implementation of universal school choice led to a *mixed system* where public and private schools coexist and compete for students. This systemic transformation provides a rich setting to study how competition and choice influence educational outcomes. The next sections outline the methods researchers have used to evaluate these impacts and present the empirical findings on academic achievement and equity in Chile, followed by comparisons to other countries’ experiences.

## 3. Data and Methodology

Evaluating the effects of school choice in Chile (or elsewhere) poses several challenges. Families self-select into schools, and private schools may “cream-skim” higher-achieving or more advantaged students. Therefore, simple comparisons of test scores between public and private schools can be misleading. To obtain unbiased estimates, researchers have employed various econometric strategies:

* **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**: One approach leverages temporal or geographic variation in the intensity of voucher competition. For example, following the 1981 reform, some communities saw a larger increase in private school enrollment than others. Hsieh and Urquiola (2006) use a DiD-like strategy comparing communes (municipalities) that experienced greater private school growth to those that did not, tracking changes in outcomes over time. Similarly, to evaluate the 2008 targeted voucher (SEP), studies compare outcomes before vs. after the reform between groups of students or areas more and less affected by the additional funding. **Correa, Parro, and Reyes (2014)** apply a DiD design at the market level to test the SEP program’s effects on test scores, exploiting that the reform injected resources specifically for low-income students.

* **Regression Discontinuity (RD)**: Some policy changes create cutoffs that allow for RD designs. In Chile, one potential RD is the threshold for receiving additional voucher funds or entry into selective schools. While our literature review did not find a prominent RD-based study for the 1981 voucher, other contexts have used RD to examine school choice impacts (e.g. admission cutoffs for oversubscribed schools).

* **Instrumental Variables (IV)**: To address selection bias, researchers have sought instruments that affect the likelihood of attending a private (voucher) school but not directly achievement. One instrument used in the literature is *distance to the nearest private school* or density of private schools in a region. The logic is that in areas with more private schools nearby, students are more likely to use vouchers, but the proximity itself is arguably unrelated to a given child’s innate ability. By instrumenting private enrollment with such measures, one can estimate the causal effect on outcomes (though ensuring the validity of the instrument is challenging).

* **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)**: While Chile’s universal program was not randomly assigned, evidence from other countries’ voucher programs (Milwaukee, New York City, Colombia’s PACES, etc.) relies on lotteries to allocate scholarships when demand exceeds supply. These studies provide complementary evidence on the potential impact of school choice in a controlled setting. We incorporate findings from these experiments in our international comparison section as external benchmarks.

* **Structural Models**: A recent strand of research estimates economic models of school and family behavior to simulate policy effects. For instance, **Neilson (2018)** develops a supply-and-demand model for Chile’s primary education market, using the introduction of the targeted voucher to calibrate how schools’ pricing power and quality effort respond to changes in voucher design. Such models, while complex, can decompose the effects into components (e.g. improved school quality vs. resorting of students) and test counterfactual policies.

Our analysis in this paper synthesizes results from these methods rather than conducting a new single-method study. We draw on official data from Chile’s Ministry of Education (e.g. enrollment figures, national test scores), international datasets (PISA results from OECD, and regional assessments from UNESCO’s LLECE such as the TERCE exam), and a selection of high-quality empirical studies. Table 2 summarizes the key data sources and outcomes considered:

* **National Learning Assessments**: The *SIMCE* (Sistema de Medición de la Calidad de la Educación) is Chile’s standardized testing program, which provides data on student achievement in reading, math, and other subjects at various grade levels. We use SIMCE-based findings (e.g. score gaps between sectors, trends over time) where available. For example, one consistent SIMCE finding is that *private voucher schools have higher average scores than municipal schools by about 0.3–0.4 standard deviations*, though this raw gap does not account for student background differences.

* **International Tests (PISA, TIMSS)**: We use results from the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) from 2000 onward to gauge Chile’s performance relative to other countries and over time. PISA provides metrics not only on mean scores in reading, math, and science, but also on equity indicators (like the score difference associated with socioeconomic status). Chile also participated in TIMSS (Trends in International Math and Science Study) in some years, and we note relevant findings (Hsieh and Urquiola observed that Chile’s relative position in TIMSS deteriorated slightly from 1970 to 1999).

* **Educational Attainment and Graduation**: We compile statistics on high school graduation rates and progression to tertiary education in Chile as broad outcome measures. While test scores capture academic learning, ultimate educational attainment is crucial for long-term economic effects. Any notable impacts of vouchers on graduation (positive or negative) are highlighted, including comparisons with findings from U.S. voucher experiments which often track graduation.

* **Segregation and Equity Metrics**: To quantify *school segregation*, researchers use indices such as the dissimilarity index or isolation index based on student family background. We report findings on how segregation in Chilean schools evolved from the late 20th century into the 21st century. Additionally, we consider the **socioeconomic achievement gap** – typically measured by the difference in PISA scores between the top and bottom quartiles of socioeconomic status (SES). We contextualize Chile’s SES-based gap relative to the OECD average gap.

Throughout the analysis, we prioritize evidence from studies employing rigorous methods (e.g. controlling for confounding factors or leveraging natural experiments). When citing findings, we include references to the original studies or data reports. It should be noted that isolating the causal impact of school choice on a nationwide scale is inherently difficult; as such, our conclusions will sometimes rely on weight-of-evidence and triangulation across multiple studies, rather than a single definitive experimental result. Nevertheless, a coherent picture emerges regarding the academic and distributional effects of Chile’s school choice regime.

## 4. Academic Outcomes under School Choice in Chile

### 4.1 Test Scores and Learning Achievement

After more than 40 years of universal school vouchers, how has Chile’s educational performance fared? The evidence suggests a nuanced picture: moderate improvements in test scores in the early decades, but no dramatic gains compared to a no-voucher counterfactual, and a leveling off of progress in recent years. National and international assessments provide three main insights on academic outcomes:

* **No Initial Surge in Achievement from Vouchers:** Several studies examining the 1980s and 1990s found little evidence that the introduction of vouchers boosted average academic outcomes in Chile. In their seminal study, Hsieh and Urquiola (2006) reported *“no evidence that choice improved average educational outcomes as measured by test scores, repetition rates, and years of schooling”* in the first two decades of the reform. Instead, the main effect observed was a redistribution of students: many middle-class students left the public system for voucher private schools, but this did not translate into higher overall achievement nation-wide. Essentially, any competitive gains may have been offset by peer effects or resource losses in public schools. Hsieh and Urquiola noted that *“the central effect of the school voucher program in Chile appears to have been to facilitate the exodus of the Chilean middle class from public schools”*. This middle-class flight meant public schools ended up with a higher concentration of disadvantaged students, which can depress their average performance. Indeed, in communities where private enrollment grew the most, the remaining public school students saw a relative decline in test scores and higher grade repetition compared to similar communities with less private growth. This pattern suggests that the sorting effects may have undermined any system-wide academic gains in the early years.

* **Long-Run Trends: Modest Improvement, Then Stagnation:** On international metrics, Chile showed gradual improvements through the 2000s, making it one of Latin America’s top performers, but scores have plateaued more recently. Figure 1 in a World Bank analysis of PISA results shows Chile’s trajectory from 2000 to 2015: Chile’s 15-year-olds gained roughly 40 points in reading (about 0.4 standard deviations) between 2000 and 2015, and smaller gains in math and science. Specifically, Chile’s PISA reading score rose from 410 in 2000 to 459 in 2015. These are *“small but consistent gains”* over time, which made Chile an outlier in the region for sustained improvement. By 2018, however, performance flattened: Chile’s average scores in PISA 2018 were statistically similar to 2015 in all subjects, and PISA 2022 results showed no further improvement (indeed, math scores dipped slightly amid a broader global decline). In PISA 2022, Chile scored 448 in reading, 412 in math, and 444 in science, each about 30–60 points below OECD averages. These outcomes indicate that despite Chile’s market-driven approach, the country has not yet converged to the academic performance levels of wealthier OECD nations. At the same time, Chile remains *the top performer in Latin America* on PISA, outscoring all other LAC countries in 2018 and 2022. The lack of recent gains has raised concerns that Chile faces *“performance stagnation unless it is able to better address stubborn equity gaps”* – linking the issue of outcomes with equity, as discussed in the next section.

* **Effects of the 2008 Targeted Voucher Reform:** The Preferential School Subsidy (SEP) program, introduced in 2008, injected resources targeted at low-income students and imposed accountability contracts. There is evidence that this reform had a positive impact on test scores, in contrast to the lackluster effects of the earlier unrestricted voucher system. Using a difference-in-differences design, Correa et al. (2014) find a *“positive and significant effect of \[targeted] vouchers on standardized test scores”*. Importantly, their analysis highlights that tying additional funding to specific educational improvements (and directing it to disadvantaged students) produced measurable gains. This suggests that the design of voucher policies matters greatly: a *flat voucher* given equally to all may simply reshuffle students, whereas a *progressive voucher* with extra support for the neediest can yield academic benefits when coupled with oversight. Consistent with this, Neilson (2018) finds that under SEP, voucher schools serving low-income populations raised their quality by about 0.12 standard deviations on average, with the greatest improvements among previously lower-performing schools. Public schools also improved under SEP; one study noted public schools’ average test scores rose by 0.16σ, narrowing the gap with private schools in many areas. The mechanism appears to be that the *“targeted voucher diminished local market power of schools in poor communities,”* forcing schools to compete on academic quality rather than simply selecting students, and provided extra resources that were invested in improving teaching and learning. In short, Chile’s only significant system-wide test score gains in the last two decades coincided with policy adjustments that targeted inequities.

Beyond test scores, we consider **high school graduation and higher education** outcomes. National statistics show that Chile’s high school graduation rate has improved substantially since the 1980s, reaching about 85% of students completing 12 years of schooling (up from nearly 60% in the early 1980s). However, it is difficult to attribute this rise directly to the voucher system, as many social and educational investments (lengthening compulsory education, economic growth, etc.) likely contributed. There is little evidence that the voucher reform caused a discrete jump in graduation rates; if anything, increased sorting could have made it harder for some disadvantaged students to finish school. On the other hand, small-scale voucher experiments elsewhere have found positive effects on educational attainment – for instance, a privately funded voucher lottery in New York City was found to increase college enrollment for African-American students (though not for other groups). In Chile’s case, comparable longitudinal micro-data is sparse, but one study following students in the 2000s found that those who attended private subsidized schools were more likely to enroll in college than similar students in public schools (potentially due to better academic preparation or family expectations, but causality is unclear). Overall, the academic *quantity* of education attained has risen in Chile, yet the role of choice in this trend remains an open question; what is clearer is that the *quality* of learning, as per test scores, saw only incremental gains except when policy consciously targeted quality improvements for the poor.

In summary, Chile’s nationwide school choice system has *not* delivered dramatic across-the-board improvements in academic performance. Average achievement rose moderately (particularly in the 2000s) but leveled off, and a substantial gap remains between Chile and the highest-performing education systems globally. The evidence suggests that without additional interventions, simply having schools compete for students via vouchers did not ensure broad-based gains in learning outcomes. The next section delves into the other side of the equation: how did this system affect equity and segregation? The Chilean experience indicates that any discussion of outcomes cannot be divorced from shifts in who attends which schools.

### 4.2 Public vs. Private School Performance

A recurring question is whether private voucher schools perform better academically than public schools in Chile. Raw test scores are indeed higher on average in private subsidized schools, but this gap largely reflects differences in student intakes. Before controlling for student background, voucher schools outperform public schools by roughly 0.3–0.4 standard deviations on national assessments. However, when one accounts for socioeconomic status (SES) and prior achievement, the differences shrink substantially. Many studies have found *little to no true advantage* in academic outcomes for voucher schools once like-to-like comparisons are made. For example, a multi-level modeling analysis by Mizala and Torche (2012) confirmed that the sector differences in test scores become small and statistically insignificant after adjusting for students’ family characteristics and peer composition. In some estimations, municipal schools even slightly *outperformed* voucher schools in value-added, suggesting that any sector performance gap is driven by selection rather than school effectiveness.

It is also instructive to look at **PISA results by school type**. In PISA 2015, Chilean students in public schools scored *considerably lower* than those in private schools. The World Bank’s review noted: *“on average, students in public schools perform considerably worse than those attending private schools”*. But this comparison doesn’t adjust for socioeconomic differences—Chile’s public school students are disproportionately from lower-income, lower-educated families. Indeed, the same report highlighted that *even compared to other Latin American countries’ public school students*, Chile’s public school pupils had lower scores. This indicates that Chile’s public sector serves a particularly disadvantaged population, which is an outcome of the voucher-era sorting. When the OECD adjusted for SES in its analysis of PISA data, it found *“no statistically significant performance difference between students in private and public schools after accounting for socio-economic status”* in Chile. In other words, the apparent private school advantage in Chile largely disappears after controlling for student background, echoing patterns seen in Sweden and other voucher-adopting countries.

One area where school type might matter is in *curriculum or pedagogy*, but evidence is mixed. Some voucher schools (especially non-religious for-profits) have been criticized for teaching to the test or narrowing curriculum to attract enrollments via scores. Public schools, in contrast, faced less pressure to select students and might invest more in inclusion. These qualitative differences are hard to measure, but education scholars note that the competitive pressures in Chile led many schools to focus on *SIMCE prep*, sometimes at the expense of broader educational goals. The net impact on learning is ambiguous: test preparation can boost scores but not necessarily deeper learning. For our purposes, the key takeaway is that the **sector per se is not destiny** – many public schools in Chile achieve excellent results (especially selective ones), and many private voucher schools perform at or below the level of similar public schools. The school choice system has created a stratified network, but within each layer there is variation in quality.

## 5. Educational Equity and Segregation

Perhaps the most profound effects of Chile’s school choice policies have been on the distribution of students and the stratification of the school system. While the previous section showed relatively small overall learning gains, the *inequalities* in who gets access to quality education have been a central concern. We examine two interrelated aspects: **socioeconomic segregation of schools** and **achievement gaps** between advantaged and disadvantaged students.

### 5.1 Socioeconomic Segregation of Schools

By most accounts, Chile’s voucher system led to increased sorting of students by socioeconomic status (SES) across schools. During the decades following the reform, researchers observed a rising divide such that poor and rich students increasingly attended different schools. A recent longitudinal study of Chilean school segregation (1999–2015) concluded: *“Results show that the segregation of both disadvantaged and wealthy students increased to extremely high levels during the first period \[1999–2007], and has not shown signs of any significant decrease since then.”*. Even after 2008, when some policies aimed to ameliorate segregation, the improvements were slight and driven mainly by eliminating tuition fees in some private schools, rather than by reducing selective admissions. By international standards, Chile exhibits very high between-school segregation by income. For example, an OECD report noted that *80% of the most advantaged quartile of students attend a private (subsidized or paid) school, whereas only 38% of the least-advantaged quartile do*. This gap is striking: affluent students overwhelmingly opt out of the public system, clustering in voucher and paid private schools, while lower-income students are concentrated in municipal schools or lower-cost private schools.

The design of the voucher program initially exacerbated segregation through several mechanisms. First, **financial barriers** played a role: private voucher schools were allowed to charge “top-up” fees starting in the 1990s. Even though these fees were capped, they were sufficient to discourage or exclude poorer families, who could instead attend tuition-free municipal schools. This created a *two-tiered system among voucher schools* – some serving those who could afford a co-pay (often middle-class families) and others remaining free but generally catering to lower-income students. Second, many private schools exercised **selective admissions** (via entrance tests or interviews), since until 2016 there were few restrictions on creaming the “best” students. As a result, motivated or academically strong students from all backgrounds tended to be taken by the private sector, leaving behind a public sector with a disproportionate share of students with learning difficulties or other disadvantages. Hsieh and Urquiola (2006) described this as voucher schools “skimming off” higher-SES and higher-achieving students, leading to increased between-school variance in student characteristics.

Studies quantifying segregation find that Chile’s between-school segregation (by SES) is among the highest for any country with available data. One measure is the **dissimilarity index**, which ranges from 0 (each school has the same mix of students as the overall population) to 1 (complete separation of groups in different schools). In Chile, the dissimilarity index for low vs. high SES students rose significantly from the 1980s to 2000s, reaching levels (around 0.5–0.6 by some estimates) that are very high for a single school district or city, let alone a nation. Another measure, the **between-school variance in performance attributable to SES differences**, also highlights stratification. As of PISA 2018, over 50% of the variance in Chilean students’ reading scores lay between schools (rather than within schools), one of the highest shares in the OECD. By comparison, in an equitable system like Finland’s, only about 10–15% of variance is between schools (most differences are within each school). This indicates Chile’s schools are internally more homogeneous and externally more divergent. Indeed, one analysis noted Chilean schools tend to be *“highly homogeneous in the SES of their student body”*, meaning each school often serves either mostly high-SES or mostly low-SES students, with fewer mixed environments.

The Chilean government, recognizing the segregation issue, enacted the Inclusion Law (2016) which banned selective admissions (except at the high-school level where some specialization is allowed) and mandated random lotteries for oversubscribed schools, and also phased out co-payments. These changes aim to reduce barriers and mix students of different backgrounds. It is too early to fully evaluate their impact, but initial reports (2017–2019) showed a slight increase in disadvantaged students attending what were formerly semi-private schools, and a slight decrease in segregation indices (as also noted in the Gutierrez & Carrasco study for 2008–2015). However, the changes are incremental; reversing decades of stratification is a slow process. Additionally, *geographic factors* contribute to segregation: wealthier families often live in different neighborhoods (or communes) than poorer families, and even with open enrollment, proximity and transportation can limit true mixing.

It is important to contrast Chile’s experience with segregation to that in other countries with school choice. For example, Sweden saw increased school segregation after its voucher reform, though the magnitude is debated. The Netherlands and Belgium have long histories of publicly funded private schools (often religious), but they implement centralized admissions to ensure balance, and income segregation in those countries is lower than in Chile. The U.S. charter school experience has been mixed: in some cities, charter schools increase racial or economic segregation (as families with resources navigate choice better), whereas targeted lottery systems can avoid that. Chile stands out because the scale of unregulated choice was so vast that market forces dominated, leading to *market segmentation*: high-end schools catering to elites (with or without vouchers), mid-tier schools for middle-class voucher users, and under-resourced public schools for the poor. This stratification has serious implications for equity, as discussed next.

### 5.2 Socioeconomic Achievement Gaps

With greater sorting of students by SES, one might expect achievement gaps to widen. Indeed, in the initial decades of the voucher system, Chile’s socioeconomic achievement gap was large. However, there is an interesting nuance: by some measures, Chile’s SES-based performance gap is *comparable to or even smaller than* the OECD average in recent years. For example, in PISA 2018, the score difference between the top 25% and bottom 25% of SES in Chile was about 89 points in reading, whereas the OECD average gap was around 98 points. In PISA 2022, Chile’s math gap was 69 points, significantly *smaller* than the OECD gap of 93 points. This seems counter-intuitive given the discussion on segregation. Why would Chile’s SES test score gap appear moderate? There are a few explanations:

* **Compression at the Top**: Chile’s top students (often in elite schools) perform well, but not as spectacularly as top students in countries like the US or UK. Meanwhile, Chile’s lowest SES students perform at very low levels, similar to low SES students elsewhere. In effect, the range from bottom to top is somewhat compressed in Chile (in part because even “advantaged” Chilean students are only slightly above OECD averages, as noted in the World Bank report). The World Bank analysis phrased it as: *“the top 20% of students by socioeconomic status pack in 3.5 more years of schooling than the bottom 20%; those at the top are slightly above the OECD average whereas those at the bottom are at the regional average”*. In other words, high-SES Chilean students do well by Latin American standards but are not far above the OECD mean, whereas low-SES students are very low (about 3.5 years behind the high-SES in learning). This yields a large absolute gap in terms of years of learning (as the quote indicates) but when expressed in PISA points relative to OECD distribution, it doesn’t look as extreme as in some unequal countries.

* **Education System Efforts to Lift the Bottom**: Chile has implemented numerous programs to raise outcomes in low-performing schools (e.g. P900 in the 1990s, SEP in 2008, extended school day, teacher development initiatives). These may have helped improve the scores of the most disadvantaged students, preventing the gap from growing further. For instance, targeted vouchers under SEP showed stronger gains for lower-performing schools, which would narrow gaps.

* **Metric Issues**: The SES achievement gap can be measured in various ways. If measured as between-school variance, Chile looks very unequal. If measured as overall variance attributable to SES (including within-school), Chile’s figure might be lower than expected because within any given school, students are more homogenous in SES (so the *within-school* SES effect is low). Essentially, Chile’s inequality is manifested more in *segregation between schools* rather than *steep socio-economic gradients within schools*. So on a regression of score on SES at the student level, the coefficient might not be off the charts, but that’s partly because high-SES and low-SES students seldom sit in the same classrooms in Chile.

From a policy perspective, however, the remaining SES gap is still very concerning. A gap of 3.5 years of learning between rich and poor at age 15, as noted, is substantial. Chile’s education system, by sorting students, also potentially *amplifies peer effects*: low-SES students often lack exposure to high-SES peers who might bring additional academic stimulus, and vice versa. Research by Mizala and Torche found that the *“association between individual SES and test scores is slightly stronger in the private-voucher sector than in the public sector”*, implying achievement is more tied to family background in voucher schools. This could be due to peer composition—private voucher schools tend to have clusters of either advantaged or less-advantaged students, making a student’s own SES and school SES highly correlated. In municipal schools, there is also correlation, but because some public schools still serve mixed neighborhoods, a poor student might more often be in a middle-SES public school than in the private sector.

Another dimension of equity is **ethnic or racial gaps**. Chile is more homogenous compared to, say, the United States, but there are important groups (indigenous Mapuche population, immigrants from neighboring countries). Segregation and achievement gaps for indigenous students have also been documented, though socioeconomic status plays a large confounding role. Generally, indigenous and immigrant students in Chile perform below the national average, and they are concentrated in lower-performing schools, compounding disadvantage. These trends mirror the socioeconomic stratification since ethnic minority status often correlates with lower SES in Chile.

The overall picture is that Chile’s school choice regime, especially in its early decades, **increased educational inequality between schools**. Critics argue that the voucher system *“has served to increase socio-economic segregation between schools”*. Even the OECD, typically a proponent of market mechanisms, highlighted Chile’s high stratification as a weakness in need of policy correction. The fact that public schools became the “safety net” primarily for the poor is evident in data: *“children from families in the lowest income groups enroll in public schools at much higher rates than do children from the middle-class”*, who use vouchers to attend private schools. This sorting not only raises fairness issues but may also depress the overall quality of education (due to peer effects and inefficient resource allocation).

The reforms in the 2010s (no selection, no co-pay, non-profit requirement) are aimed at **improving equity**. Preliminary signs (2017–2019) suggest a modest decrease in segregation as some formerly exclusive schools began taking a more diverse intake. Yet, significant inequality remains ingrained. It is telling that even with choice, *only 1% of Chilean students are top performers in math on PISA (Level 5 or 6), compared to 9% OECD average*. This hints that the system has not cultivated high excellence perhaps due to fragmented quality. Conversely, a larger share of disadvantaged Chilean students are “academically resilient” (scoring in the top quartile internationally among low-SES) than the OECD average (13% vs 10%), which could be seen as a success of certain interventions in high-poverty schools.

In conclusion, the Chilean model dramatically expanded choice but at the cost of stratification. Academic outcome gains were modest and took targeted policies to materialize, while inequities in access and peer environments grew significantly. Chile’s experience thereby offers valuable lessons, which we now turn to by comparing with other countries.

## 6. International Comparisons

Chile’s school choice system is often viewed as an archetype of market-oriented education reform. Comparing Chile’s outcomes with those in other countries can help distill generalizable insights on vouchers and school choice. In this section, we consider evidence from both **developed countries** (like the United States, Sweden, and the Netherlands) and **Latin American peers**. We focus on common themes: impact on test scores, and impact on equity/segregation.

**United States (Selective Charter and Voucher Programs):** The U.S. does not have a nationwide voucher system, but numerous city- or state-level programs and a large charter school sector provide analogies. Rigorous evaluations of *targeted voucher programs in the US* (e.g., Milwaukee’s voucher, the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship, Louisiana’s voucher) have produced mixed results. Recent meta-analyses indicate that vouchers in some U.S. locales led to *test score declines* for participants, especially in newer programs. For instance, evaluations in Washington D.C., Indiana, Louisiana, and Ohio in the mid-2010s *“show some of the largest test score drops ever seen ... between -0.15 and -0.50 standard deviations of learning loss”* for voucher users. These are substantial negative impacts, akin to the disruption of a pandemic in magnitude. On the other hand, studies have found that some voucher programs can increase **high school graduation** and college enrollment. In Washington D.C., for example, voucher lottery winners had higher graduation rates than non-winners, despite little difference in test scores. Similarly, a review notes *“data does indicate an uptick in high school graduation rates among voucher users in the U.S., and Black students in particular”*. This suggests that even when test score effects are absent or negative, there might be other benefits (parent satisfaction, school climate, or non-cognitive skills) that contribute to educational attainment.

The U.S. charter school findings are also heterogeneous. Some charter schools, especially “no-excuses” charters in urban areas, have demonstrated large achievement gains for low-income minority students (based on lottery studies). This shows that choice coupled with innovative school models can work under certain conditions. However, other charters perform no better than public schools, and some exacerbate segregation by drawing away higher-achieving students. The key lesson from the U.S. is that **choice alone is not a guarantee of quality**; accountability and school effectiveness matter. Unlike Chile’s universal approach, U.S. choice programs are often accompanied by strong accountability (charters can be shut down for poor performance, voucher students must take tests, etc., though enforcement varies). Chile initially lacked such accountability, which likely contributed to the divergence in school quality.

**Sweden (Universal Voucher since 1992):** Sweden introduced a nationwide voucher system in 1992, allowing students to attend independent (private) schools with public funding. Superficially, Sweden’s reform was similar to Chile’s, although important differences include: Swedish municipalities still play a role in coordinating admissions; private (independent) schools cannot charge tuition on top of the voucher (they must operate only on the public funding); and for-profit schools are allowed and became common (as in Chile). Sweden’s experience has been intensely debated, especially because Sweden’s PISA scores fell dramatically in the 2000s. Between 2000 and 2012, Sweden had the steepest decline in PISA of any participating country, which led some to blame the voucher system. Careful analysis, however, indicates a complex picture. First, only about 14% of Swedish students attend independent schools – the majority (86%) remain in municipal schools. Thus, any systemic decline had to involve public schools too. Indeed, the PISA data showed that performance dropped in both sectors: *“results in public schools deteriorated by 33 points, while results in private schools declined by 25 points”* from 2003 to 2012 (the latter was not statistically significant). Moreover, after accounting for student SES, there was *no significant performance difference between private and public schools* in Sweden, much like Chile. This implies that independent schools were not dramatically outperforming publics; their existence also did not halt the decline in public school scores.

However, Sweden did see an **increase in segregation** attributed to school choice. Studies by Böhlmark and Lindahl (2015) found that segregation by immigrant status and family education increased somewhat in the 1990s and 2000s as choice expanded. One analysis summarized: *“there is evidence that school choice increased socioeconomic segregation somewhat”*. Yet, they argue this segregation is not the primary driver of Sweden’s overall performance drop, as test scores fell across the board, not just among disadvantaged groups. The Swedish case highlights that a universal voucher in a developed country can yield similar patterns to Chile: modest or no aggregate gains, some sorting by SES, and private schools doing about as well as publics after controlling for student background. One notable difference is that Sweden tightly regulated tuition (no co-pay allowed), so financial barriers were lower than in Chile. Even so, subtle barriers and self-selection led certain schools to cater to particular demographics (e.g., ethnic Swedish middle-class families vs. immigrant families).

Another contrast is outcomes beyond test scores. Sweden’s choice reform did not harm upper secondary completion or tertiary enrollment – those continued to rise overall. But grade inflation became a concern, as competition led schools to possibly award higher grades for the same performance (something also alleged in Chile’s private schools). The policy debate in Sweden continues, with recent proposals to restrict profit-making in schools. In effect, Sweden’s results echo Chile’s in cautioning that **universal choice without robust quality oversight** may not improve average results and can increase stratification.

**Netherlands and Belgium (Long-standing Public-Private Mix):** These countries historically fund both public and private schools (mostly religious) on equal footing – a system in place for over a century in the Netherlands. These are sometimes cited to show that choice need not breed inequality, because both countries have high overall performance and reasonably high equity by OECD standards. The difference is that funding is equitable and admissions are often coordinated to avoid exclusivity. Schools cannot charge tuition in the Netherlands for primary/secondary, and open admissions are mandated (first-come or lottery if oversubscribed). As a result, there is a lot of choice (parents choose among many schools, including Protestant, Catholic, secular, etc.), but socioeconomic segregation is moderated. In the Dutch case, because almost all schools (public or private) are fully funded and cannot select on money, the sorting is more on preference (ideology/pedagogy) than on student ability or family income. The implication for Chile is that **choice can be compatible with equity if the system is designed with strict fairness rules** – for instance, no additional fees and controlled admissions. Chile for a long time did not have those guardrails (only now moving in that direction), which may explain why its outcomes diverged.

**Colombia (PACES voucher experiment):** An interesting comparator in Latin America is the PACES program in Colombia, which was a targeted voucher lottery for low-income families in the 1990s. Unlike Chile’s universal approach, PACES offered a limited number of vouchers via lottery in certain cities. Researchers Joshua Angrist and colleagues studied this experiment and found positive long-term effects: PACES lottery winners were more likely to finish high school, had higher test scores, and higher earnings in the labor market years later than non-winners. This suggests that *vouchers can have beneficial effects when given to disadvantaged students* to access private schools that they otherwise could not afford. The contrast with Chile’s universal program is telling – PACES was a marginal intervention in a mostly public system, whereas Chile transformed the whole system. It may be that vouchers work better as a supplemental policy (targeting individual opportunity) than as the backbone of an entire education system without other supports. Additionally, the PACES program required recipients to maintain good academic standing to continue receiving the voucher, injecting an accountability mechanism at the student level.

**Other Latin American Countries:** Most Latin American countries, aside from Chile and to some extent Colombia and Peru, retained predominantly public education systems. Some, like Argentina and Uruguay, have significant private sectors (often Catholic schools) but without voucher funding. When comparing PISA outcomes, Chile outranks most Latin American countries in test scores, but its advantage was already present in the 1970s (Chile had relatively higher educational attainment and income back then). The region as a whole improved in the 2010s, with Peru making notable progress without a voucher system (instead focusing on standards and teacher training). This suggests that vouchers are not the only path to improvement, and perhaps not the most effective one in some contexts.

**Synthesis of International Evidence:** A comprehensive survey of school voucher research by Epple, Romano, and Urquiola (2017) concludes that: (a) small-scale voucher programs show mixed academic results, often no clear improvement, and occasionally negative effects, though some yield gains for specific subgroups; (b) large-scale universal voucher programs (Chile, Sweden) lead to *increased sorting by student ability and background*, with varying impacts on achievement; (c) there is evidence that competition from vouchers can induce public schools to improve, but these effects are not large enough to dramatically raise national performance. They highlight that *“evidence on both small-scale and large-scale programs suggests that competition induced by vouchers leads public schools to improve”*, which is encouraging, but also that *“the evidence to date is not sufficient to warrant recommending that vouchers be adopted on a widespread basis”* as a magic bullet. The nuanced position is that well-designed programs (with accountability and equitable access) can harness competition benefits while limiting adverse sorting. Chile’s recent policy adjustments, such as the SEP targeted funding and the inclusion mandates, reflect an attempt to move in that direction – making the voucher system more progressive and regulated.

Finally, it’s worth noting that some high-performing countries have minimal school choice. For instance, Finland, Korea, and others rely predominantly on assigned public schools with national curriculum standards. These countries achieve both high quality and high equity without vouchers or charters. This does not prove choice is detrimental (those societies differ in many ways), but it demonstrates that *lack of choice is not the bottleneck for quality* in top systems. Parents in those countries typically trust their local public schools due to consistent quality. In Chile, the exodus to private schools can be interpreted as a response to uneven quality and perhaps a cultural preference given the policy environment.

In conclusion, the international evidence underscores a few key points that resonate with Chile’s experience: **1)** Unregulated choice tends to increase stratification; **2)** Academic gains from choice are not guaranteed and often require complementary policies (targeted resources, accountability) to materialize; **3)** The success of school choice is highly context-dependent, and what works in one country (or subset of students) may not automatically work in another. Chile’s bold experiment provided a wealth of data on these issues, influencing debates worldwide.

## 7. Discussion and Conclusion

Chile’s school choice journey offers a cautionary tale along with insights for crafting better education policies. The overarching outcome is that simply introducing market mechanisms into education—via vouchers and competing schools—did not yield the substantial efficiency gains that proponents hoped for, and it amplified inequities in who gets access to quality education. At the same time, tweaks to the system have shown that design and regulation matter enormously: when Chile made vouchers *more progressive* (higher funding for the poor) and constrained schools’ selective behaviors, it observed improvements in outcomes for disadvantaged students and a slowing of the segregation trend.

From an economics perspective, why didn’t unrestricted choice revolutionize educational quality in Chile? One interpretation is that the *incentive structure* for schools under the initial voucher model had flaws. Schools competed for students, but in a context without strong information or accountability, many schools chose strategies like selective admission or marketing rather than genuinely investing in instructional quality. With each student carrying a roughly equal voucher value, schools had financial incentive to enroll students cheaply rather than to produce dramatically better learning outcomes. The fact that public schools lost many higher-SES students meant they also lost the funding that came with those students (since funding was per head). This left some public schools in a financial spiral, unable to innovate or improve, and in turn reinforced families’ perceptions that public schools were inferior. In technical terms, the general-equilibrium effect was that the positive competitive pressure was offset by a negative composition effect on the public sector. Thus, any *productive efficiency* gains at the school level did not translate into system-wide gains, because who was being taught where changed concurrently (and disadvantaged concentrations increased in some schools).

The equity implications are perhaps even more crucial. Education is not just an ordinary market good; it has social externalities and equity considerations. A highly segregated education system can entrench social divides and reduce equality of opportunity. Chile’s extreme between-school segregation has likely contributed to its wider income inequality and social tensions (inequality in Chile has been among the highest in the OECD). Indeed, public discontent with education inequality was a major theme in student protests that have periodically erupted in Chile since 2006 (the “Penguin Revolution” of high school students) and in the early 2010s. Those pressures eventually pushed policymakers to enact the 2016 Inclusion Law to tame some excesses of the market approach.

For policy and research, the Chilean case underscores the importance of **rigorous impact evaluation** of systemic reforms. With hindsight, one might ask: could the negative effects on segregation have been foreseen and averted? Possibly, had there been pilot programs and data to analyze in the 1980s. However, Chile’s voucher reform was implemented abruptly without prior trial, driven by ideological convictions more than evidence (Friedman’s free-market vision exported by the “Chicago Boys”). It took decades of ex-post research to identify the outcomes we discuss. Going forward, any country considering broad school choice reforms would benefit from Chile’s lessons and from gradual implementation with evaluation checkpoints.

In an empirically rigorous sense, we can draw a few **conclusions** that are supported by the evidence compiled:

* **Academic Outcomes:** Chile’s universal voucher system did not significantly raise average academic performance in basic education, though modest improvements were observed in certain periods. The major performance gains occurred after targeted funding and accountability were introduced for disadvantaged schools, not from the pure market forces alone. This suggests that competition by itself was not a panacea; schools need capacity and incentives to use competition productively. These findings align with global evidence that vouchers are not a guarantee of improved test scores.

* **Educational Equity:** The voucher policy in its original form exacerbated educational inequalities. It led to greater segregation by socioeconomic status, as wealthier and more informed families took greater advantage of choice. The socioeconomic achievement gap in Chile remained large, and public school students were left behind, performing worse on average than even public school students in other Latin countries. Only after policy adjustments did the trends show slight reversals, highlighting that equity safeguards are necessary in choice systems.

* **Comparative Insight:** Other countries’ experiences validate many of Chile’s outcomes. Unchecked choice often leads to sorting (seen in Sweden’s case and some U.S. contexts), and the benefits for achievement are inconsistent. However, when choice programs are well-targeted or implemented with equity in mind (e.g., lottery-based scholarships, or controlled-choice schemes), they can help particular groups without harming overall outcomes. The diversity of international results, from success stories in small programs to failures in others, reinforces that context and policy details determine results more than the abstract idea of “choice” itself.

In framing Chile’s experience for an academic audience, one might ask: what does it teach us about the role of market forces in public services? Education economists often consider issues of information asymmetry, principal-agent problems, and externalities. In Chile, parents had information mainly from annual school tests (SIMCE scores published in newspapers) and word-of-mouth, which is an imperfect measure of school quality. Schools had an incentive to game those measures (teach to the test or selectively admit students likely to score well). This is a classic example of metrics distortion when a single indicator is overemphasized. Additionally, the social value of having integrated schools (where students of different backgrounds learn together) was not internalized by individual choices—each family acted in its own interest, understandably, but the collective outcome was increased segregation, an externality not accounted for in the market transaction. These dynamics illustrate how market design in education must account for more than just consumer choice; regulations are needed to align individual incentives with social goals.

In conclusion, Chile’s four-decade experiment with school choice yields a sobering yet instructive narrative: **Choice policies must be carefully engineered to deliver on the promises of increased quality while safeguarding equity.** Simply funding students and allowing schools to compete is not enough. Measures such as equitable funding supplements, transparent accountability for learning outcomes, and inclusive admissions policies are crucial. Chile has begun to implement some of these correctives, and early results are promising (e.g., narrowed SES score gaps in PISA). The Chilean case also emphasizes that education reforms can have long-lasting structural effects that take years to manifest in data, so continuous monitoring and willingness to adjust course are vital.

Education is a multi-faceted endeavor: **school choice is one tool, not a silver bullet.** The Chilean experience, in comparison with global evidence, suggests that when choice is one part of a comprehensive strategy that includes investing in teacher quality, early childhood education, and strong curricula, it can play a role in fostering improvement. But if choice becomes an end in itself, absent those supports, it risks creating a two-tier system. Policymakers in Chile and elsewhere are thus advised to balance the efficiency gains from competition with the equity goals of public education. Achieving quality **and** equality remains the fundamental challenge – one that Chile continues to grapple with, and from which the world can learn.
